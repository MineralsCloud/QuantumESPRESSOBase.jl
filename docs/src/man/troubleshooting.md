## Cannot find the Julia executable

Make sure you have Julia installed in your environment. Please download the latest
[stable version](https://julialang.org/downloads/#current_stable_release) for your platform.
If you are using a *nix system, the recommended way is to use
[Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). If you do not want to install Juliaup
or you are using other platforms that Julia supports, download the corresponding binaries.
Then, create a symbolic link to the Julia executable.
If the path is not in your [`$PATH` environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)),
export it to your `$PATH`.

Some clusters, like
[Comet](https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html),
or [Expanse](https://www.sdsc.edu/services/hpc/expanse/index.html),
already have Julia installed as a module, you may
just `module load julia` to use it. If not, either install by yourself or contact your
administrator.

See [Installation Guide](@ref) for more information.

## Julia starts slow

First, we recommend you download the latest version of Julia. Usually, the newest version
has the best performance.

If you need to use Julia for a simple, one-time task, you can start the Julia REPL with

```bash
julia --compile=min
```

to minimize compilation or

```bash
julia --optimize=0
```

to minimize optimizations, or just use both. Or you could make a system image
and run with

```bash
julia --sysimage custom-image.so
```

See [Fredrik Ekre's talk](https://youtu.be/IuwxE3m0_QQ?t=313) for details.
